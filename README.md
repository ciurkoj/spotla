# Spotlas is one of my recruitment tasks. 

Based on a given design template, I've created a flutter app that fetches data from an API, serialises it and presents it to a user on an instagram-like feed. User can save a post using a star button or double tap to like the post. 
Each Post Widget is fetched via Future builder and then displayed in a ListView built by a List builder. The feed can be refreshed by dragging the list down. 

## Getting Started

To run the app, please use ``` flutter pub get && flutter run```
